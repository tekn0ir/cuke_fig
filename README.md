### Bug Reports

If you are sure that it's a bug in Fig, open a new [issue] and try to
answer the following questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?

Please also post code to replicate the bug. Ideally a failing test would be
perfect, but even a simple script demonstrating the error would suffice.

  relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Create topic branches**. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, send
  multiple pull requests.
